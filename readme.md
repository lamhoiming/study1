Begin April 5, 2019 Lam Hoi Ming, scripts and data from TG

1. this is a study on CryoVEx 2014 Danish team flight data in comparison to CPOM individual pass (IP) from CryoSat-2
the danish data are from airborne EM, total snow plus ice thickness
the R script provide a 15(?)km gird based on RIOPS projection(?)
and look for IP data point within each grid, average to obtain the mean, which is placed as the value at the centre of the grid

Will also use CPOM IP freeboard data and calculate ice thickness using RIOPS snow depth and isostatic, and compare with danish AEM thickness
*But when you do AEM thickness minus RIOPS snow, does it create bias or conflicts, since the isostatic is also using RIOPS as input? Ask TG!!

2. also will look into statistical distribution of snow depth or ice thickness within a satellite grid cell e.g. 15km to see whether it follows a normal distribution or other 
for this i can use York CryoVEx 2014 dataset which is every 6 meters along lines, so for a 15km grid there will be many points
will also study AEM data for distribution 
will need at least 30 randomly located grid distribution to look for in/consistency
do a lit review!!
